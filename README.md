# ww1_soldiers

A web app to show people who fought in the First World War in context. 

There are lots of community run websites collecting information from memorials, what remains of official records, and user submitted data. But these websites often fall short in usability, and rarely go further than displaying the data.

## Aims:
- Collect data on people who fought in the First World War, from community run efforts like [Burnley in the Great War](http://burnleyinthegreatwar.info/), [Sheffield Soldiers of the Great War](https://www.sheffieldsoldierww1.co.uk/Home.html);
- Display that data in a readable, searchable interface;
- Add extra contextual data, such as maps of soldiers' addresses when they signed up, census data about their occupations, how old they were, how many died;
- Show aggregate statistics - how many soldiers per house, per street, per area, of a certain occupation.
